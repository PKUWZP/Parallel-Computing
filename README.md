This repository includes C/C++ codes for parallel computing works I have done at Rice University. These codes also serve as the tutorial materials that I taught in a variety of short courses/summer bootcamps at Rice University. 

Part of the codes were written for the purpose of teaching parallel computing short-course on campus, or for the assignment of the PhD course of paralell computing. 

If you have any question, feel free to reach out to the author (Zhipeng Wang, zhipengbayern@gmail.com). 

The repository contains 4 modules: 

1. Parallelization of Othello program written in Cilk++ 

2. Using OpenMP to parallelize Linear Equation solver by Gaussian Elimination and back substitutions. 

3. Employing MPI for parallel solving matrix product problems using 2.5D matrix multiplication algorithms

4. Implementation of parallel bitonic sorting algorithms using CUDA programming.
